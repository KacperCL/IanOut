  https://github.com/sztupy/IanOut

Installation
============

To install IanOut, please extract the files into a directory of your choice,
then use the Config application to set the Fallout 2 master.dat and Fallout 2
critter.dat locations. These files are usually found on the root installation
directory of the installed game. Please note that currently only Fallout 2
files are supported.

Music
-----

If you'd like to hear music inside the game, then please copy over the .acm
files from the Fallout 2 "sound/music" directory over to the music directory
of IanOut, then run the convert.bat command found inside that directory, which
will convert the music files into .ogg, that can be used by IanOut

FAQ
===

What is IanOut?
---------------
IanOut is an emulator for Fallout 1 and 2. It's a standalone engine
which basically looks, feels and acts like Fallout.

Is IanOut a game in the sense that it has a campaign?
-----------------------------------------------------
Yes, IanOut will come bundled with a campaign(possible several even),
you are however free to replace it with your own or one of your choice.
IanOut is more like an engine than a game in it's essence, think of it
like something similar to NWN where you spend most of your time playing
the fan-made modules not the original. That's how IanOut is going to be.
Of course we'll be putting down energy on making the campaign as enjoyable
as possible for you.

Why IanOut?
-----------
The main problem of Fallout was, that it was very hard to create mods
for it. The main object of IanOut is to create an engine, which has a
completely documented Mod Development Kit, so everyone can create his
own post-apocalyptic world.

How?
----
Almost everything in the game is a simple txt file, which can be edited
by hand, the MAP and ACT files can be edited with the help of the Level
Editor, and the FRM files are loaded from the master.dat and critter.dat
file of Fallout. 

What do I need to get started with IanOut?
------------------------------------------
All you need is a copy of Fallout 2 (legally acquired of course), the
IanOut installer, and approximately 10 minutes.

These files are the sources of the IanOut Beta 3. You can find the licence of the source in the licence. file. 
The main object of releasing the code is to help the develepomenet of the game. Of course you can create your own clones too, but I personally don't want hundreds of "IanOut clones"... But acording to the licence you have to give me full credit, and you have to licence the new game under the OSL2.0 too (so it has to be open source too)

About the files... I din't put comments into the source, if you have questions please write to ianout@freemail.hu. If you want to optimise / improve the code, write to the same address too. 

Oh. And you have to copy the binaries into the _Output directory before compiling...

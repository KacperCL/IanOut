What is IanOut?
---------------
IanOut is an emulator for Fallout1 and 2. It's a standalone engine which basically looks, feels and acts like Fallout.

Is IanOut a game in the sense that it has a campaign?
-----------------------------------------------------
Yes, IanOut will come bundled with a campaign(possible several even), you are however free to replace it with your own or one of your choice. IanOut is more like an engine than a game in it's essence, think of it like something similar to NWN where you spend most of your time playing the fan-made modules not the original. That's how IanOut is going to be. Of course we'll be putting down energy on making the campaign as enjoyable as possible for you.

Why IanOut?
-----------
The main problem of Fallout was, that it was very hard to create mods for it. The main object of IanOut is to create an engine, which has a completely documented Mod Development Kit, so everyone can create his own post-apocalyptic world.

How?
----
Almost everything in the game is a simple txt file, which can be edited by hand, the MAP and ACT files can be edited with the help of the Level Editor, and the FRM files are loaded from the master.dat and critter.dat file of Fallout. 

What do I need to get started with IanOut?
------------------------------------------
All you need is a copy of Fallout 2 (legally acquired of course), the IanOut installer, and approximately 10 minutes.
